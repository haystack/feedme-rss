  <div>The FeedMe<img src="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/haystack/feedme/like.png" class="feedme-logo-icon" /> Bar is a Firefox extension that learns what your friends like to hear about and helps you share it with them. Basically, the FeedMe Bar lets you know which of your friends may be interested in the website you're looking at and makes it easy for you to send them a quick email with a link to the website.</div>
