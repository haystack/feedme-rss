<p>Over the past few weeks, some of your friends (including {{shared_posts.0.sharer.user.email}}) have been beta testing a sharing tool from MIT called FeedMe. We're the MIT students who built the darn thing, and we'd like to get a better sense of whether it's helping the world.  And by "world," we mean <b>you</b>.</p>

<p>If you fill out this very quick survey by answering the questions and replying to this e-mail by noon on Wednesday, we'll enter you in a drawing to win a $30 gift certificate to Amazon.com!</p>

Here are one or more posts that you received from FeedMe. Just answer two questions below each post by replying to this e-mail:

{% for shared_post in shared_posts %}
{% block post_title %}<a href="http://feedme.csail.mit.edu{% url server.feedme.clickthrough.clickthrough shared_post.pk %}{{ shared_post.post.url|urlencode }}">{{ shared_post.post.title }}</a>{% endblock %}, via {% block feed_title %}{{ shared_post.post.feed.title }}{% endblock %}<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20px">from {{ shared_post.sharer.user.email }}{% ifnotequal shared_post.comment "" %}: "{{ shared_post.comment|escape|urlize|linebreaksbr }}"{% endifnotequal %}</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20px">Did you see this post somewhere other than the e-mail from {{shared_post.sharer.user.email }}? [answer yes/no]: _____</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20px">In a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), how strongly do you agree with the following statement: </span> <span style="margin-left: 20px">"I am glad that I received this post." [answer 1-7]: _____</span><br />
