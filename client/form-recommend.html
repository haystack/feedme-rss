Here's the two ways, 'sledgehammer' and 'scalpel,' we recommend for keeping yourself in the loop while minimizing constant distractions.</p> <p><em>Photo by <a target='_blank' href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/pipeapple/3280609082/'>Pipe ?</a>.</em></p> <p>Before we pull out the big guns, make sure you've taken a good look at the social sites you use and the information filtering features they offer. Facebook, for instance, offers a really great 'Hide' tool that you get by hovering over the right-hand side of any update on your main 'News Feed' page—click it, and you can either stop hearing from Suzy TalksTooMuch, or prevent anyone from ever telling you which Lord of the Rings race they'd belong to.</p> <p>Also, these tools won't be new to regular readers with a flair for the web, but they are good at what they do, and worth forwarding to friends and relatives you've heard complaining about being overwhelmed. There's no substitute for willpower and time rationing, of course, but let's be realistic and show you how to manage your compulsive time-wasters:</p> <h3 style='font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;'>The Sledgehammer: <a target='_blank' href='http://nutshellmail.com/'>NutshellMail</a></h3> <p><img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/04/nutshell_sledgehammer.png' style='display: block;' width='406' height='222'>It might seem counter-intuitive to sign up for <em>another</em> web service to majorly reshape the others, but you have no idea what kind of power <a target='_blank' href='http://nutshellmail.com/'>NutshellMail</a> can give you. It solves what we'll call the Email Alert Circle, which goes something like this:</p> <ul> <li>You log into social sites and speed-read all the new stuff, but it's destroying your free time, and your brain! It's just too much. You stop visiting so often, but wish you could still get the most relevant stuff from them. So you switch to...</li> <li>Oh, look, email alerts! Now you can get <em>just</em> the direct messages, replies, and relevant friend posts. <em>Two weeks later ...</em></li> <li>You're now avoiding your email inbox and decide it, too, is just too much.</li> </ul> <p>So get a free account at NutshellMail. Authorize it to parse your Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and/or LinkedIn accounts, and it takes all those 'John Smith commented on your status' and 'Lindsay Jones sent you a direct message' emails you really don't need to see Right This Minute and delivers them in a digest whenever and however you want them.</p> <p><img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/04/nutshellmail2.png' width='263' height='166'>'But my Twitter replies are crucial to my self-est..I mean, it's an of-the-moment service!' you say. Fine—go ahead and schedule your NutshellMail updates to arrive every so many hours, depending on your addiction. You'll still get all the updates for everyone you're following, and you won't even have to hop into Twitter.com/TweetDeck/Tweetie/whatnot to reply, because NutshellMail lets you <a target='_blank' href='http://lifehacker.com/5167734/nutshellmail-updates-can-reply-to-twitter-by-email'>@ reply via email links</a>.</p> <p>For those who can be realistic about how connected they need to be, NutshellMail takes the constant back-to-work hurdles of email updates, known as <a target='_blank' href='http://lifehacker.com/software/ask-the-readers/how-do-you-handle-bacn-291688.php'>bacn</a> in some circles, and pounds them into one flat page of your kinda-need-to-know.</p> <h3 style='font-size: 120%; margin-top: 20px;'>The Scalpel: RSS Filtering</h3> <p><img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/05/facebook_rss.png' width='359' height='249'>Maybe you're not ready to give up on as-they-happen social updates entirely. Or maybe even your NutshellMail round-ups are still filled with updates you don't care about, from people you can't unfriend, but don't want to follow. RSS to the rescue!</p> <p><a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rss'>RSS</a>, in the simplest terms, is a stream of the latest headlines, posts, and other updates from web sites that change frequently. Just like weblogs, most of the major <a target='_blank' title='Click here to read more posts tagged SOCIAL NETWORKS' href='http://lifehacker.com/tag/social-networks/'>social networks</a> offer RSS feeds of your friends' activity. Let's run through setting up a <a target='_blank' title='Click here to read more posts tagged FEED READER' href='http://lifehacker.com/tag/feed-reader/'>feed reader</a>, grabbing the feeds from your social sites, and then sifting the cruft out of them.</p> <p>What works best will depend on your computer preferences, but here's a few casual, non-programmer-level options that everyone can use:</p> <p><strong>Google tools:</strong> If you're a Gmail user, it's fairly easy to add an <a target='_blank' href='http://lifehacker.com/5151822/feed-reader-for-gmail-adds-rss-gadgets-to-your-inbox'>feed reader to the sidebar</a>, which provides an easy glance at what's happening without forcing you to click away. You could get even more discrete by adding your social feeds to the top-scrolling <a target='_blank' href='http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=18219'>Web Clips</a>. And if <a target='_blank' href='http://google.com/ig'>iGoogle</a> is your start page, you can create a few boxes that contain all your social chatter. Click the 'Add Stuff' link at the far right of your page, then look at the bottom-left of the page it links you to for an 'Add Feed or Gadget' button. Paste in an RSS feed, and you're good to go.<br> <img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/05/feed_demon.png' width='213' align='right' height='168'><strong>Dedicated Feed Reader:</strong> If it looks like you're going to have a lot of material to get through every day (and, hey, that's why you're reading, right?), you might want to get set up with something a bit more powerful than a small widget on a web page. Here's our shortlist: Use <a target='_blank' href='http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx'>FeedDemon</a> for a dedicated Windows program, its sibling <a target='_blank' href='http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/'>NetNewsWire</a> on Macs, or read on the web with <a target='_blank' href='http://reader.google.com'>Google Reader</a>. All those options are fairly powerful, offer offline access, and make reading through a whole lot of news a lot easier. Want to have both online and desktop access to your social and other feeds? Grab a copy of <a target='_blank' href='http://lifehacker.com/5234049/feeddemon-30-beta-syncs-to-google-reader'>FeedDemon's 3.0 beta that syncs to Google Reader</a>, and you can check your feeds at your computer or anyone else's.</p> <p>Now, if you're wondering where to grab those feeds, here's the lowdown:</p> <ul> <li><img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/05/facebook_feed.png' width='169' height='105'><strong>Facebook:</strong> Click on Inbox after logging in, then click the Notifications tab near the top of the center panel. The link for your friends' status updates is on the right. Note, however, that Facebook's feed only covers straight-up status updates. For the whole firehose, you'll need to install a Facebook app like <a target='_blank' href='http://lifehacker.com/5234269/newsfeed-rss-makes-facebook-streams-more-manageable'>Newsfeed RSS</a>.</li> <li style='list-style-type: none; list-style-image: none; list-style-position: outside;'><br></li> <li><img src='http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2009/05/twitter_feed.png' width='131' height='108'><strong>Twitter:</strong> Scroll down to the bottom of your right-hand bar at Twitter.com, and there's a link for 'RSS Feed.'
